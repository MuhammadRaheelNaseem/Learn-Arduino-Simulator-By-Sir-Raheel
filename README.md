Wokwi Arduino simulator is a browser-based simulator where you will build your projects. You can find several Arduino boards such as Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, Arduino Nano etc. You will get a lot of peripherals such as LEDs, resistors, push buttons, slide switches, OLED displays and humidity sensors.

# `Virtual Online Arduino Simulator projects`

`What is this about?`

In this series of projects, we will look at the Arduino simulator and how to build and simulate Arduino projects. We will use a free Arduino Simulator (Wokwi).

`About Wokwi Arduino Simulator`

Wokwi Arduino simulator is a browser-based simulator where you will build your projects. You will find several Arduino boards such as Arduino UNO, Arduino Mega, Arduino Nano etc. You will get a lot of peripherals such as LEDs, resistors, push buttons, slide switches, OLED displays, humidity sensors, PIR motion sensors and more! You can use all these peripherals for free and build your own project. wokwi Arduino simulator is an alternative for the Tinkercad Arduino simulator.

You can access the projects you build from anywhere if you login into the Wokwi Arduino simulator website.

Here are the section description

1. `Arduino sketch tab` - you will write the sketch here (copy and paste as well)

2. `Share button` - Click on this button to easily create a shareable link

3. `Save button` - Click on this button to save the project (so that you can refer to the project later)

4. Here you will be able to select Arduino peripherals

5. `Docs` - This takes you to the support document section where you will find more details about the parts along with the example projects

6. `Sign-in button` - You can sign in if you want to save the projects online for future access

7. `Simulation section` - Here is where you place and connect the parts

8. `Editor window` - Here you edit your code as well as add more libraries

`STEP 6:` Let us construct the project. Click on the purple icon and select the "LED" ðŸ˜€
